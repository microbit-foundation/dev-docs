## Getting Started With the micro:bit Hardware

The micro:bit hardware is based on the Arm-Mbed platform. It has an application processor with lots of on-chip peripherals. Some off-chip peripherals are connected to this chip.

There is an interface processor connected to the application processor, and it is the interface processors job to manage communications over the USB and to support the drag-and-drop code-flashing process. The interface processor does not connect to any of the micro:bit peripherals.

Two key pieces of information to help understand the internals of the micro:bit are:

* The [schematics](../schematic), which show the detailed component data and connectivity of the device.

* The [reference design](../reference-design), which is a complete module design of a compatible micro:bit, providing a starting point for anyone interested in understanding the micro:bit or designing their own variant.

## Hardware Description

### nRF51 Application Processor

The nRF51 application processor is where user programs run. A single, complete application including user code, runtime code and bluetooth stack is loaded and run directly from on chip flash memory. All user accessible GPIO pins are provided by this processor.

There is an on-board 2.4GHz radio engine used to provide Bluetooth capabilities via an off-chip aerial.

### Bluetooth Wireless Communication

The on board 2.4GHz transceiver supports Bluetooth communications via the Nordic S110 SoftDevice, which provides a fully qualified Bluetooth low energy stack.
This allows the micro:bit to communicate with a wide range of Bluetooth devices, including smartphones and tablets.

### Low Level Radio Communications

The on board 2.4GHz transceiver supports a number of other radio communications standards, including the proprietary Nordic Gazell protocol.
This protocol provides a very simple small-packet broadcast radio interface between other devices that support this protocol, such as other micro:bit devices.
The 'radio' interface that appears in a number of the languages on the micro:bit is built on top of this Gazell protocol.
Additionally, the micro:bit runtime software adds a 'group code' to each data payload, allowing for simple user managed device addressing and filtering to take place.

### Buttons

The two buttons on the front of the micro:bit, and the one button on the back, are tactile momentary push-buttons. The back button is connected to the KL26 interface processor and to the nRF51 processor for system reset purposes. Pushing this button will reset the application, regardless of whether it is powered from USB or battery.

The front "A" and "B" buttons can be programmed in the user application for any purpose.
A and B are debounced by software, which also includes short press, long press, and 'both A+B' press detection. Buttons operate in a typical inverted electrical mode, where a pull-up resistor ensures a logical '1' when the button is released, and a logical '0' when the button is pressed.
Both A and B buttons are connected to GPIO pins that are also accessible on the micro:bit edge connector.

### Display

The display is a 5x5 array of LEDs.
It is connected to the micro:bit as a 3x9 matrix. The runtime software refreshes this matrix at a high speed, such that it is within the user persistence of vision range, and no flicker is visible.
This LED matrix is also used to sense ambient light. It does this by momentarily switching some of the LED drive pins into inputs and sampling the voltage decay time, which is roughly proportional to ambient light levels.

### Motion sensor

The 1.5 micro:bit variant has a combined accelerometer and magnetometer chip  that provides 3-axis sensing and magnetic field strength sensing.
It also includes some on board gesture detection (such as fall detection) in hardware, and additional gesture sensing (e.g. logo-up, logo-down, shake) via software algorithms.
A software algorithm in the standard runtime uses the on board accelerometer to turn readings into a board orientation independent compass reading.
The compass must be calibrated before use, and the calibration process is automatically initiated by the runtime software.
This device is connected to the application processor via the I2C bus.

The v1.5 micro:bit has a footprint for two different motion sensors: one made by ST (the LSM303AGR) and one by NXP (FXOS8700CQ). The micro:bit DAL supports both of these sensors, detecting them at runtime. To date, all v1.5 boards have been manufactured with the LSM303AGR. If we were to move to the NXP part, a round of testing would be required and we would notify the [DAL and Devices mailing list.](http://eepurl.com/dyRx-v)

### General Purpose Input/Output Pins

The edge connector brings out many of the GPIO circuits of the application processor. Some of these circuits are shared with other functions of the micro:bit, but many of these extra circuits can be re-allocated to general purpose use if some software features are turned off.

Note: the nRF51 datasheet states that GPIO pins may be in std-drive (0.5mA) and high-drive (5mA) mode, with a maximum of 3 pins in high-drive mode at any one time.

### USB Communications

The micro:bit has an on board USB communications stack, that is built into the firmware of the interface chip. This stack:

* provides the ability to drag and drop files onto the MICROBIT drive in order to load code into the application processor,
* allows serial data to be streamed to and from the micro:bit application processor over USB to an external host computer,
* supports the CMSIS-DAP protocol for host debugging of application programs.

### Debugging

The interface processor can be used with special host tools to debug code that is running on the application processor. It connects to the application processor via 4 signal wires.

The KL26 interface processor code can also be debugged via it's integral SWD software debug interface, for example to load initial bootloader code into this processor at manufacturing time, or to recover a lost bootloader.
