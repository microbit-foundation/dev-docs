## Overview

Bluetooth applications can run on a variety of devices, including but not limited to smart phones and tablets. You can also run Bluetooth enabled applications on devices such as a Raspberry Pi.

Below is a curated list of some Bluetooth applications you might like to read about and try for yourself on your micro:bit. Please contribute to this list if you know of any more. Many listed here are taken from the [micro:bit Awesome list](https://github.com/carlosperate/awesome-microbit)

## Applications, tools and examples
