Bluetooth applications can run on a variety of devices, including but not limited
to smart phones and tablets. You can also run Bluetooth enabled applications
on devices such as a Raspberry Pi.

Below is a curated list of some Bluetooth applications you might like to read
about and try for yourself with your micro:bit. Please contribute to this list
if you know of any more. Many listed here are take from the [micro:bit Awesome list](https://github.com/carlosperate/awesome-microbit)
