## Overview

bitio (pronounced bitty-o) is a micro:bit I/O library for Python. It allows you to run code in Python on a PC/Mac/Linux/Raspberry Pi and interact directly with the micro:bit. It works with both Python 2 and with Python 3 on Mac, PC, Raspberry Pi and Linux.

## Why would you use bitio?

bitio is useful if you want to use the micro:bit as an input or output device for other programs, e.g. for Minecraft: Tilt your micro:bit, and something happens in the Minecraft world. It can be used anywhere you might want to use the input and output devices on the micro:bit inside a Python program on a bigger computer.
