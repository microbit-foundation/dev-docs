## Use of the  I2c bus

The I2c bus for the latest revision of the micro:bit separates the I2c lines into Internal and External use. The [previous revisions share the I2C bus](../i2c-shared/) with the Edge connector and nRF chip.

The internal lines run to the Nordic chip and communicate with the motion sensor and KL27 interface.

The external lines run to the edge connector and can be used for accessories.

### Table of addresses used

|                     | accelerometer    | magnetometer (compass) | KL27 |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| motion sensor variant 1 (LSM303AGR) | 0x19 (0x32/0x33) | 0x1E (0x3C/0x3D)  | TBC 
| motion sensor variant 2 (FXOS8700CQ) | 0x1F (0x3E/0x3F) | 0x1F (0x3E/0x3F) | TBC

This means 0x1E, 0x1F and 0x19 are reserved for onboard use.

### Table of address used by micro:bit accessories (please edit)
If you make an accessory for the micro:bit, please help us by editing the table below and sharing the details of the i2c addresses you use.

| accessory name | organisation | i2c address(es) used | 
|----------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| [EDU:BIT](https://www.cytron.io/p-edubit)| Cytron Technologies | 0x08 (0x10/0x11) |


### Acceptable capacitance for I2C accessories

In our recent testing for the motion sensor change, we found that a 10nF cap connected SCL-GND slowed down the i2c bus, but it continued to operate. Separately, capacitance was added to SDA until it ceased operation:
- 100KHz continued with 1nF but failed with 2nF.
- 400kHz continued with 150pF but failed with 180pF.
No difference was seen between the revisions.

## Notes

The <span class="v2">V2</span> device can be woken by activating the combined sensor interrupt on P0.25. This signal is connected between the nRF52, the KL27, and motion sensors and requires the nRF52 internal pull up to be configured, even while the device is sleeping.
