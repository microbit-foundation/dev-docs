## The micro:bit developer community site

This site aims to sit between a community wiki and a technical datasheet for the micro:bit.
The content is available to [edit on Github](http://github.com/microbit-foundation/dev-docs) and is [openly licensed through Creative Commons](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/dev-docs/blob/master/LICENSE.MD).

The site is maintained by the Micro:bit Educational Foundation in order to document the hardware and software that make the micro:bit work the way it does.

We hope to encourage contributions into these projects in order to broaden our ecosystem and the range of things people can invent with a micro:bit.

The Micro:bit Educational Foundation aims to be a 'responsible downstream' to the many open source [software](https://tech.microbit.org/software/) projects that are used to build the micro:bit:  much like a good Linux distribution collates, tests, stabilises and releases combinations of many diverse open source packages, the micro:bit Educational Foundation and the micro:bit community present micro:bit users with a stable, tested release of all the things you need to make the magical 'end-to-end' micro:bit experience.

## Help us build it

If you'd like to help us make the micro:bit better, then there are a number of ways that you can get involved.

### Code

Contribute features and fixes to one of the upstream projects that the micro:bit relies upon:

  * The micro:bit [Device Abstraction Layer (DAL/runtime)](https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs/)
  * The [MakeCode Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-microbit)
  * The [Python Editor](https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/PythonEditor)
  * [DAPlink](https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink)

### Build

Help us build a brilliant hardware ecosystem around micro:bit - derivative boards, cool accessories and add ons, or even suggestions for future versions of the micro:bit.

  * The [micro:bit schematic](/hardware/schematic/) and [reference design](/hardware/reference-design) are good places to start for making your own projects
  * The [accessories guide](https://microbit.org/buy/accessories/) gives you an idea of what's currently available.

### Write

  * [Improve the documentation and this site](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/dev-docs), either reporting issues or adding documentation will be extremely helpful.
  * Help build a community around micro:bit - join the [slack channel and Email list](/community/), share the things you've created on twitter, blog about them!
