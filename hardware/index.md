## Getting Started With the micro:bit Hardware

The micro:bit is a Single Board Computer (SBC) that contains an application processor with a variety of on-chip perhipherals.Other peripherals are connected to this chip.

An interface processor is connected to the application processer and manages communications via the USB interface, including the drag-and-drop code flashing process. The interface processor does not connect to any of the micro:bit peripherals.

Two key pieces of information to help understand the internals of the micro:bit are:

* The [schematics](./schematic), which shows the detailed component data and connectivity of the device.

* The [reference design](./reference-design), which is a complete module design of a compatible micro:bit, and is designed to be a starting point for anyone interested in understanding the micro:bit or designing their own variant.


## Hardware Description

### nRF52 Application Processor

The nRF52 application processor is where user programs run.
A single, complete application including user code, runtime code and Bluetooth stack
is loaded and run directly from on chip flash memory.
All user accessible GPIO pins are provided by this processor.
There is an onboard 2.4GHz radio peripheral used to provide Bluetooth and custom radio capabilities
via an off-chip aerial.

### Bluetooth Wireless Communication

The on board 2.4GHz supports Bluetooth communications via the [Nordic S140 SoftDevice](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Software/S140),
which provides a fully qualified Bluetooth low energy stack.
This allows the micro:bit to communicate with a wide range of Bluetooth devices,
including smartphones and tablets.

### Low level radio communications

The on board 2.4GHz transceiver supports a number of other radio communications standards, on which we build the microbit-radio protocol
This protocol provides a very simple small-packet broadcast radio interface between other devices
that support it, such as other micro:bit devices.
The 'radio' interface that appears in a number of the languages on the micro:bit
is built on top of this protocol.
Additionally, the micro:bit runtime software adds a 'group code' to each data payload,
allowing for simple user managed device addressing and filtering to take place.

### Buttons

The two buttons on the front of the micro:bit, and the one button on the back,
are tact momentary push-to-make buttons. The back button is connected to the KL27
interface processor and to the NRF52 processor for system reset purposes. This
means that the application will reset regardless of if it is powered from USB
or from battery.

Front buttons A and B can be programmed in the user application for any purpose.
A and B are debounced by software, which also includes short press, long press,
and 'both A+B' press detection. Buttons operate in a typical inverted electrical mode,
where a pullup resistor ensures a logical '1' when the button is released,
and a logical '0' when the button is pressed.
Both A and B buttons are connected to GPIO pins that are also accessible on the micro:bit edge connector.

### Display

The display is a 5x5 array of LEDs.
It is connected to the micro:bit as a 5x5 matrix.
Runtime software repeatedly refreshes this matrix at a high speed,
such that it is within the user persistence of vision range, and no flicker is detected.
This LED matrix is also used to sense ambient light,
by repeatedly switching some of the LED drive pins into inputs and sampling the voltage decay time,
which is roughly proportional to ambient light levels.

### Motion sensor

The micro:bit has a combined accelerometer and magnetometer chip that provides 3-axis sensing and magnetic field strength sensing.
It also includes some on board gesture detection (such as fall detection) in hardware,
and additional gesture sensing (e.g. logo-up, logo-down, shake) via software algorithms.
A software algorithm in the standard runtime uses the on board accelerometer
to turn readings into a board orientation independent compass reading.
The compass must be calibrated before use, and the calibration process is automatically initiated by the runtime software.
This device is connected to the application processor via the I2C bus.

The micro:bit has a footprint for two different motion sensors: one made by ST (the LSM303AGR) and one by NXP (FXOS8700CQ). The micro:bit DAL supports both of these sensors, detecting them at runtime. Only one sensor will ever be placed.

### General Purpose Input/Output Pins

The edge connector brings out many of the GPIO circuits of the application
processor. Some of these circuits are shared with other functions of the micro:bit, but
many of these extra circuits can be re-allocated to general purpose use if some software

### USB communications

The micro:bit has an on board USB communications stack, that is built into the firmware
of the interface chip. This stack provides the ability to drag and drop files onto the
MICROBIT drive in order to load code into the application processor. It also allows
serial data to be streamed to and from the micro:bit application processor over USB to
an external host computer, and supports the CMSIS-DAP protocol for host debugging
of application programs.

### Debugging

The interface processor can be used with special host tools to debug
code that is running on the application processor. It connects to the application
processor via 4 signal wires. The KL27 interface processor code can also
be debuged via it's integral SWD software debug interface, for example to
load initial bootloader code into this processor at manufacturing time, or to
recover a lost bootloader.
