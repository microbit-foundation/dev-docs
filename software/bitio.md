## Overview
bitio (pronounced bitty-o) is a micro:bit I/O library for Python. It allows you to run code in Python on a PC/Mac/Linux/Raspberry Pi and interact directly with the micro:bit. It works with both Python 2 and with Python 3 on Mac, PC, Raspberry Pi and Linux.

### Why would you use bitio?
The library is useful if you want to use the micro:bit as an input or an output device for other programs, e.g. for Minecraft. Tilt your micro:bit, and something happens in the Minecraft world. It can be used for anything though, where you want to use the input and output devices on the micro:bit inside a Python program on a bigger computer.

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions in the project [README.md](https://github.com/whaleygeek/bitio#getting-started)

## Projects
There are various projects linked to in the README, but a couple of the more technical ones include:

 - Sean M. Tracey has written a [Node Red wrapper for bitio](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-bitio-wrapper)

 - Giles Booth has created a [micro:bit controlled internet Radio](http://www.suppertime.co.uk/blogmywiki/2017/08/microbit-controlled-radio/)
