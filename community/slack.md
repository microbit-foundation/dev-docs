The micro:bit community is spread across the world, building cool things with micro:bits and writing the software that runs on them. Many micro:bit hardware and software resources are openly licensed, and we encourage and support contributions from anyone.

If you'd like to be part of the world-wide micro:bit developer community, here's how to get started:

## Subscribe to the Developer and ecosystem newsletter
