## Overview

Aside from the officially supported editors: [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org) 
and [Python](https://python.microbit.org) there are a number of different 
languages that include support for the micro:bit.

This resource aims to compile a list of these programming languages with a link
to the documentation, plus an example program.

## Submissions
To add a new language to the page, [edit the page on  Github](http://github.com/microbit-foundation/dev-docs/edit/master/software/other-languages.md). For a language to be accepted it's implementation must be complete enough to display a heart on the display!

Please format the addition using this template:
