# Microbit Developer Community Docs - PRIVATE mirror

These docs are a private mirror of [dev-docs](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/dev-docs) which are then rendered into the [micro:bit Developer Commmunity site](http://tech.microbit.org)

## Using these docs

If you are here, you will have been added to this PRIVATE repository by a member of the Foundation.

The docs are continuously evolving in line with the development of the latest revision of the micro:bit board and we are aiming to create a release at the time of public announcement.

As such, they may not be fully up-to-date but comments, issues and Pull Requests are welcomed and encouraged. Please review the [Foundation community and brand guidelines](https://microbit.org/community/) and the [tech.microbit.org](http://tech.microbit.org) homepage for further details about contribution.
