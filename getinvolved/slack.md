The micro:bit community is already spread across the world, building cool things
with micro:bits and building the software that runs on them. Many micro:bit hardware and software resources are openly licensed, and we want to encourage and support
contributions from anyone interested. 

If you'd like to be part of the world-wide micro:bit developer community, then there are a couple of ways you can do this.
