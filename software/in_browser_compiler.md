## Overview

There are a number of different code editors for the micro:bit.

Of the available editors; [MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org) and [Python](https://python.microbit.org) have an in-browser compiler. This means that when you hit the **Download** button to translate your code into a language supported by the micro:bit, all of the hard work takes place inside your web browser.

You can also use MicroPython offline by installing the [Mu editor](https://codewith.mu) on your computer.

The in-browser build process is useful, because you are not dependent on an internet connection in order to code and innovate with your micro:bit. Once you have the web page open and the editor is cached on your computer, you can work independently of internet access.

Since they are web based, these editors allow you to write code for the micro:bit without needing to install any special software on your computer. This is especially important if you are working in a previously unused classroom, or on a public computer.

## How it Works

![img](/docs/software/assets/browser-build-pipeline.png)

The above diagram shows an example of how blocks code is converted into a .hex file that can be loaded onto your micro:bit

1a. Edit your script; this is automatically saved inside the web browser cache on your computer.

1b. Press the **Download** button, and the script is first converted into javascript. The in-browser-compiler then converts it into Arm machine code instructions.

1c. The Arm machine code instructions are 'linked' with the Lancaster University runtime code, [the DAL](/software/runtime) and converted into an [Intel-HEX file format](/software/hex-format). This is done by ensuring that the in-browser-compiler knows the entry points of key functions that it needs to be able to call out into.

2. You accept the download of the .hex file, which is saved to your computer.

3. Download/Flash the .hex file onto the MICROBIT drive, and the interface processor on the micro:bit copies it into the flash memory inside the application processor. Your code now runs.

Because code is compiled in-browser, the compiler needs to have a copy of the runtime/DAL code in order to create a complete distributable package.
There is a pre-compiled copy of the runtime (DAL+Mbed) that gets loaded when you first load the editor.

## Other Features

MakeCode supports two-way conversion of code, so you can write code as blocks and see what the generated code looks like in Javascript/MakeCode Python. You can also write Javascript/MakeCode Python code, and if possible, MakeCode will convert this back into blocks automatically.

MakeCode also allows you to [write your own block types](https://makecode.com/extensions) and [publish them as Extensions](https://makecode.microbit.org/extensions).

The Python web editor does not use the in-browser compiler. It only sits inside the frame of the website, but it gains access to the save and import functionality for saving and loading scripts to local files, and to and from a cloud store.

## Contributions

The MakeCode editor is [open source](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit), so you can develop your own feature and you can [log issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/PXT-microbit/issues/new) for the dev team to look into.
