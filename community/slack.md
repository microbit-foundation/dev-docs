The micro:bit community is already spread across the world, building cool things with micro:bits and building the software that runs on them. Many micro:bit hardware and software resources are openly licensed, and we want to encourage and support contributions from anyone interested. 

If you'd like to be part of the world-wide micro:bit developer community, then there are a couple of ways you can do this.

## Subscribe to the DAL, Editors and Devices newsletter

In addition to our regular [Micro:bit Educational Foundation newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/microbit/newsletter), our [DAL, Editors and Devices](https://microbit.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=e1c30f24b90ff3d70275cfff2&id=25403c7650) newsletter is a low volume digest on the technical aspects of micro:bit.
