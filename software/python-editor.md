## Overview

The [Python Editor](https://python.microbit.org) is a free, browser based coding environment for creating [MicroPython](../micropython/) projects with the BBC micro:bit.

Use common snippets of code, add/remove files and modules, and upload/download .hex or .py files.

The Python editor is based upon the [Ace editor](http://ace.c9.io) and includes syntax highlighting, code folding and (semi) intelligent auto-indentation.

### Source

The upstream source code for the Python Editor can be found at [github.com/bbcmicrobit/PythonEditor](https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/PythonEditor)

The micro:bit target depends a closed source versioning repository that facilitates releases at `/v/`, for example the beta editor [https://python.microbit.org/v/beta](https://python.microbit.org/v/beta) and previous releases.

### Offline

It is possible to use the Python Editor offline to generate, upload and download .hex or .py files. However, refreshing the browser resets the editor.
